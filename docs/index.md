# Welcome

Following documentation aims to enable users of the Falcondale SDK as well as educate on the usage of Quantum Machine Learning resources. The aim of the Falcondale SDK is no other than help those wanting to approach Quantum Machine Learning with a Data Scientist or Analyst mindset, letting aside the need for specific knowledge on Quantum Computing.

References will be make on the methods used so that whoever that want to dig deeper into it can do so. But the main focus of Falcondale is so that it can be easy for everyone to get started into this.

But for those wanting to explore more in detail, fine-grained parameter definition is allowed as well. That way, options to select the number of shots when running on device, the type of ansatz to be used, number of iterations or even optimization technique to be used will enable those researchers wanting to explore the full spectrum of the Quantum Machine Learning landscape.

Letâ€™s get you started ðŸŽ‰
