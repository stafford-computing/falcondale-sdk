# Contribute

As you probably know, there are many ways in which you could contribute to Falcondale SDK. Feel free to reach out and
learn about the product roadmap and share your experience using the platform with us.

## Roadmap

A [roadmap exists](https://github.com/orgs/stafford-computing/projects/2) so that everyone can participate on the new features to be added and see when to expect them.

## Community

We think that by sharing is key for open source projects and that is why we created the Falcondale community where everyone can join, ask for support from colleagues already familiar with specific topics, request improvements, chat and discuss in general.
